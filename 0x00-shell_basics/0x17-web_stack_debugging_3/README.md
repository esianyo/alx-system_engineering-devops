# Apache Debugging Project

## Overview

The Apache Debugging Project is a structured approach to debugging Apache server issues using `strace` and automating the fix using Puppet. The goal of this project is to create a culture of continuous learning and improvement, helping teams to understand what happened, why it happened, and how to prevent it from happening in the future.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Apache Debugging Project, you will need to have a clear understanding of the incident that occurred. This includes the timeline of events, the impact of the incident, and the root cause.

## Debugging with strace

`strace` is a powerful command-line tool used for debugging and tracing system calls and signals. It's used in this project to attach to the running Apache process and monitor its system calls. You can use `tmux` to run `strace` in one window and `curl` in another one.

## Automating the Fix with Puppet

Once the issue has been identified and fixed, you can automate the fix using Puppet. Puppet is an open-source software configuration management tool. It runs on many Unix-like systems as well as on Microsoft Windows, and includes its own declarative language to describe system configuration.

## Documentation

The documentation for a postmortem includes an Issue Summary, a detailed Timeline, Root Cause and Resolution, and Corrective and Preventative Measures. Each of these sections provides crucial information about the incident and the steps taken to resolve it.

## Contributing

Contributions to the Apache Debugging Project are welcome. Please ensure that all postmortems are written in a respectful and constructive manner.
