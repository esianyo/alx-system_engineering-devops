## Tasks

### Task 0: ARP spoofing and sniffing unencrypted traffic

In this task, we need to get Apache to run on a Docker container and return a page containing "Hello Holberton" when querying the root of it. The goal is to sniff unencrypted traffic and get information out of it.

You can find the script for this task [here](https://github.com/holbertonschool/265-0).

### Task 1: Dictionary attack

In this task, we will perform a dictionary attack on an SSH account using Hydra. We will use Docker to run a container with an SSH server.

You can find the Docker image for this task [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/sylvainkalache/264-1).
