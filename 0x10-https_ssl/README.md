## Tasks

### 0. World wide web

Configure your domain zone so that the subdomain www points to your load-balancer IP (lb-01). Letâ€™s also add other subdomains to make our life easier, and write a Bash script that will display information about subdomains.

#### Requirements:

- Add the subdomain www to your domain, point it to your lb-01 IP
- Add the subdomain lb-01 to your domain, point it to your lb-01 IP
- Add the subdomain web-01 to your domain, point it to your web-01 IP
- Add the subdomain web-02 to your domain, point it to your web-02 IP

Your Bash script must accept 2 arguments:
- domain: domain name to audit
- subdomain: specific subdomain to audit (optional)

Output: The subdomain [SUB_DOMAIN] is a [RECORD_TYPE] record and points to [DESTINATION]

When only the parameter domain is provided, display information for its subdomains www, lb-01, web-01 and web-02 - in this specific order. When passing domain and subdomain parameters, display information for the specified subdomain.

You do not need to handle edge cases such as:
- Empty parameters
- Nonexistent domain names
- Nonexistent subdomains
