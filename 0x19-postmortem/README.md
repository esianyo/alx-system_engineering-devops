# Postmortem Project

## Overview

The Postmortem Project is a structured approach to documenting and learning from incidents or outages that have occurred within a system. The goal of this project is to create a culture of continuous learning and improvement, helping teams to understand what happened, why it happened, and how to prevent it from happening in the future.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Postmortem Project, you will need to have a clear understanding of the incident that occurred. This includes the timeline of events, the impact of the incident, and the root cause.

## Documentation

The documentation for a postmortem includes an Issue Summary, a detailed Timeline, Root Cause and Resolution, and Corrective and Preventative Measures. Each of these sections provides crucial information about the incident and the steps taken to resolve it.

### Issue Summary

The Issue Summary should include the duration of the outage with start and end times (including timezone), the impact (what service was down/slow? What were users experiencing? How many % of the users were affected?), and the root cause.

### Timeline

The Timeline should be formatted as bullet points, with each point representing a significant event in the timeline of the incident. This includes when the issue was detected, how it was detected, actions taken, misleading investigation/debugging paths that were taken, which team/individuals the incident was escalated to, and how the incident was resolved.

### Root Cause and Resolution

This section should explain in detail what was causing the issue and how the issue was fixed.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures

This section should list the things that can be improved/fixed and a list of tasks to address the issue. Be very specific, like a TODO list.
