## Corrective and Preventative Measures

Weâ€™ve conducted an internal review and analysis of the breakdown. The following are actions we are taking to address the underlying causes of the issue and to help prevent recurrence and improve response times:
- Improve our testing procedures to catch such bugs before they affect the production environment.
- Implement a more robust monitoring system for our tools to detect issues early.

- Train our team members on troubleshooting common issues with the CapCut app.
- Develop a backup plan to ensure continuity of our video productions in case of similar incidents in the future.
