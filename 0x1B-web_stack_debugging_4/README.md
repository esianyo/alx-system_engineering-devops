# Web Stack Debugging Project
## Overview
The Web Stack Debugging Project is designed to test and improve the performance of a web server setup featuring Nginx under pressure. The project involves identifying issues causing a large number of failed requests and implementing solutions to resolve them.

## Getting Started
To get started with the Web Stack Debugging Project, you will need to have a clear understanding of the incident that occurred. This includes the timeline of events, the impact of the incident, and the root cause.

## Debugging with strace
strace is a powerful command-line tool used for debugging and tracing system calls and signals. Itâ€™s used in this project to attach to the running Apache process and monitor its system calls. You can use tmux to run strace in one window and curl in another one.

## Automating the Fix with Puppet
Once the issue has been identified and fixed, you can automate the fix using Puppet. Puppet is an open-source software configuration management tool. It runs on many Unix-like systems as well as on Microsoft Windows, and includes its own declarative language to describe system configuration.

## Benchmarking with ApacheBench
ApacheBench is a tool used in this project for benchmarking your Apache HTTP server, particularly to measure the performance of your Apache server. In this project, ApacheBench is used to simulate HTTP requests to the server.

## Documentation
The documentation for a postmortem includes an Issue Summary, a detailed Timeline, Root Cause and Resolution, and Corrective and Preventative Measures. Each of these sections provides crucial information about the incident and the steps taken to resolve it.

## Contributing
Contributions to the Web Stack Debugging Project are welcome. Please ensure that all postmortems are written in a respectful and constructive manner.
